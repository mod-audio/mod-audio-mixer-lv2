# Audio mixers

This repository contains a two, four channel, mixer plugins, a mono and stereo version.
Each channel has a panning control, a mute, a solo and a volume knob.
The mixers have two stereo outputs, the first is for the mixed signals. The other one is an `alternative output`.
Once a channel is muted it will be send to this `alternative output`
